## 🔍 Project Overview

Instant delivery platforms like **Blinkit**, **Zomato**, and **Zepto** use dynamic pricing models. This project aims to:

- Analyze historical pricing trends
- Detect surge patterns
- Predict future price surges using machine learning
- Visualize trends via Power BI dashboards

---

## 🧠 Features

- 📅 Time-Series Analysis of product prices
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover surge triggers
- 🤖 Machine Learning Models for surge prediction:
  - ARIMA
  - LSTM (RNN)
- 📈 Forecasting future prices
- 🛍️ Price comparison across platforms *(optional)*
- 💸 Discount and delivery time correlation analysis
- 📊 Power BI Interactive Dashboard for insights
